# CIRCUIT_3D_OPENGL
Circuits in 3d similar to redstone in Minecraft written in C++ and OpenGL

Early stage of the application where we can create circuits in 3D. It supports keyboard and mouse input. Navigation on the map is similar to moving in Minecraft. Rendering is mainly based on a single shader - a solid shader inspired by the basic shader in Blender 3D.

Elements that we can use when creating our 3D circuit:
* 1 - clickable mode
* 2 - wire
* 3 - button
* 4 - lamp
* 5 - AND gate
* 6 - NOT gate
* 7 - 8-bit register
* 8 - 7-segment display (4-bit BCD input)
* 9 - 8-bit adder

We can rotate elements using the "R" key on the keyboard.
